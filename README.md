# Settings-tvOS
A **work-in-progress** recreation of the tvOS Settings app.

## Information
- This project is a recreation of Apple's Settings app for tvOS 26.0.1 (23J362).
- All features within the app are only simulations and have no effect on the device outside of the app.
- Features available within the app vary depending on the device model and its capabilities to make this recreation as accurate as possible.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project makes use of `TVSettingKit.framework`, a private API not meant for public use as it is not officially supported.
> It is strongly recommended to NOT use code in this project for any public apps. It may be unstable and could break at any time without notice.

## Usage
Open the project in Xcode and run with either a Simulator instance or a paired physical device running tvOS as a destination.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You may need to change the bundle identifier of the app to be able to sign it with Xcode for use on a physical device.
